I am a Master student of Applied Data Science in the [Computer Science Department](https://viterbischool.usc.edu/academics/) at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu/), and I am graduating in May 2020. [[Curriculum Vitae](https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive)]

My research interests lie in the general area of machine learning, particularly in deep learning, reinforcement learning and probabilistic graphical models, as well as their applications in sequential decision making, generative modeling, multi-task and meta-learning and multi-agent systems.
I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [University of Wisconsin Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/) and doubled major in Economics and Mathematics.
